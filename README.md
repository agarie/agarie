### Hello, hello

I'm a software engineer from São Paulo, Brazil, with a background in Control Engineering and Machine Learning, and an alumnus of the [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br/#english) and [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU)](https://erau.edu/).

I like to learn different programming languages, refactor systems and improve whatever I touch.

### Current work and what I'm looking for

I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Tarmac](https://www.tarmac.io/). I'm largely responsible for refactoring and fixing old codebases, improving test suites, and building internal dev tools. The tech stack is mostly Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, React, Docker, and a lot of AWS.

I'm interested in discussing job opportunities, specifically related to Ruby or Elixir web development, or programming language development in general.

### Hobbies and interests

- Former [Pokémon VG Tournament Organizer & Judge](https://professorprogram.pokemon.com/page/about-professors): I started the local competitive Pokémon (video game) scene in São Paulo back in 2007 and was a part of it until 2018. As part of the Professor Program, I was invited to travel to other countries (Australia, UK, US) as a Judge for International-level events.
- In 2025, I decided to get back to playing video games and earned an invitation to compete in the [Pokémon World Championship](https://worlds.pokemon.com/en-us/).
- I converted a tiny room in my apartment to a woodworking workshop. I mostly build small boxes and cabinets for our own use, but I also made our dining table.
- I keep a bunch of plants, with some bonsai (which I've been taking care for 10+ years), herbs for tea, and a guava tree.
