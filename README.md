### Hey! 

I'm a Software Engineer initially trained in Electrical Engineering and Control Systems. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at MercÃºrio, a company I cofounded in Brazil that specializes in digital repositories and digitization projects for Cultural Heritage Institutions. I wrote most of our internal tools and customized open source repository softwareâ€”like [AtoM](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/), [Archivematica](https://www.archivematica.org/en/), [DSpace](https://duraspace.org/dspace/), [Collective Access](https://www.collectiveaccess.org/)â€”to our client's needs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently:
  - Finishing [*Haskell From First Principles*](https://haskellbook.com/) after studying bits of Haskell, on and off, since at least 2012.
  - Trying to get back into the Ruby on Rails ecosystemâ€”next in my reading list is [*Sustainable Rails*](https://sustainable-rails.com/).
  - Looking to get back into front-end development by learning what has changed in JavaScript in the last few years. _This one is really difficult_.

- âš¡ Fun facts: 
  1. I studied Control Engineering at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/#english) but ended up working in software. Turns out the knowledge I developed there was useful when I designed and built a scanner for large maps while working at MercÃºrio! 
  2. I spent one year as an exchange student in Computer Engineering [Arizona, USA](https://erau.edu/). Due to the lower amount of coursework there compared to Brazil, I spent a lot of time reading and studying about computers, programming and contributing to open source communities. I still have notes written during that time that come in handy.
  3. Most of my early social life started as part of a PokÃ©mon community in Brazil, and I joined the local league as a Tournament Organizer from 2007 up until 2018. I met my wife in one of these tournamentsâ€”she ended up becoming a National Champion.
  4. Between 2016 and 2018 I was invited by The PokÃ©mon Company as a Judge for several international tournaments. Thus I can say I visited Australia, Europe and some parts of the US on Pikachu's dime.
