### Hey! 

I'm a software engineer initially trained in Electrical Engineering and Control Systems. 

I'm still not sure what to show here, so let me start by following some of the suggestions on this README template:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at MercÃºrio, a company specialized in software for Digital Repositories and Digitization projects for cultural heritage.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reading about Haskell (and using it to build a small internal tool at Mercurio) and getting back into the Ruby ecosystem. Next in my reading list is *Sustainable Rails*.
- âš¡ Fun facts: 
  1. I studied for a year in Arizona, USA. The most important part of getting this scholarship was having less coursework (compared to Brazil) and more time for reading, studying and personal projects.
  2. Most of my early social life started as part of a PokÃ©mon community in Brazil, and I joined the local league as a Tournament Organizer from 2007 up until 2018. 
  3. Between 2016 and 2018 I was invited by The PokÃ©mon Company as a Judge for several international tournaments. Thus I can say I visited Australia, Europe and some parts of the US on Pikachu's dime.
