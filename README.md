### Hey!

I'm a Software Engineer from São Paulo, Brazil.

- I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Tarmac](https://www.tarmac.io/). I'm largely responsible for refactoring and fixing old codebases, maintaining test suites, and building tooling.
- Up until 2022 I worked at Mercúrio, a company I co-founded in Brazil that specializes in digital repositories and digitization projects for Cultural Heritage Institutions. I wrote most of our internal tools and customized open source repository software.

- Fun facts:
  1. I studied Control Engineering at the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/#english) but ended up working in software development.
  2. I spent one year as a Computer Engineering exchange student in Arizona, USA ([at ERAU](https://erau.edu/)). Due to the lower amount of coursework there compared to Brazil, I spent a lot of time reading and studying about computers, programming and contributing to open source communities. I still have notes written during that time that come in handy.
  3. Most of my early social life started as part of a Pokémon community in Brazil, and I joined the local league as a Tournament Organizer from 2007 up until 2018. I met my wife in one of these tournaments—she ended up becoming a National Champion.
  4. Between 2016 and 2018 I was invited by The Pokémon Company as a Judge for several international tournaments. Thus I can say I visited Australia, Europe and some parts of the US on Pikachu's dime.
  5. In 2025 I earned an invitation to compete at the Pokémon World Championship.
